# JavaScript XSLT Transformation

Click the [link](index.html) to open `index.html` with a browser and open developer tools by pressing `option+command+I (⌥+⌘+I)`.

This example is useless, no one uses XML in the web anymore and XSLT is pretty old. Said that the browsers (not node) still
support native API to convert XML to HTML. 

This was a brilliant idea at the time, and my opinion stil is. We could transform JSON into HTML, forms, custom components, etc.

Example data is taken from [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_client.asp) check for more information.

You can get more information about XSLTProcessor from [MDN XSLTProcessor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XSLTProcessor) page.

> Note: The fetch API will not work, we have to use good old AJAX here. See `index.html` for more information.
