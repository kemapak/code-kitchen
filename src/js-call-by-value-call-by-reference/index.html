<h1>JavaScript Call by Value vs Call by Reference</h1>

<p>
    This example demonstrates JavaScript function parameter behavior. Call by Value vs call by Reference. Open your console to see the behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Every function call in JavaScript is *call by Value*. Parameter values will and cannot change outside the function scope.
    The change will only visible inside the function in other words.
</p>
<p>
    Said that, if the parameter is an object type, you can change a property of it. Objects are `Object` and `Array`.
    So you can alter the object itself inside a function and this will be visible in the parent scope as well as inside
    the functional scope.
</p>
<p>
    Object Parameter properties behave like call by reference, this makes JavaScript an oddball. Be careful when you use
    this feature.
