# HTML Expandable List or Tree web component.

In this sample I extend the HTML `UL` tag to have extra functionality. In other words use the 'decorator' design pattern.
It is very cool to see how a simple UL element turn into an expandable list or a tree.

The element is for sample only does not have the necessary and required accessibility properties. 

For more details how to extend an HTML element please take a look at [MDN - Using Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements).

Click the [link](index.html) to open `index.html` with a browser and open developer tools by pressing `option+command+I (⌥+⌘+I)`.

Please note, you must run the application in a server (localhost or remote). In file system, most browsers
does not allow loading modules.

Added Safari polyfill to support "is" extending a custom element.
