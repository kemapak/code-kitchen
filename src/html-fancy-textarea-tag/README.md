# HTML Fancy textarea, Extending `textarea` tag.

In this sample I extend the HTML `textarea` tag to have extra functionality. In other words use the 'decorator' design pattern.
Added word count to the textarea. 

The element is for sample only does not have the necessary and required accessibility properties.

For more details how to extend an HTML element please take a look at [MDN - Using Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements).

Click the [link](index.html) to open `index.html` with a browser and open developer tools by pressing `option+command+I (⌥+⌘+I)`.

Please note, you must run the application in a server (localhost or remote). In file system, most browsers
does not allow loading modules.
