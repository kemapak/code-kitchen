# code-kitchen
This is my code kitchen, my lab where I try some concepts, write some sample code.

Read README.md file for each sample lab. Even the simple HTML/JS/CSS files will have their own. 

Since this is not actual code, I do not have unit tests. I will combine, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
In real life I will never do this or do not recommend anyone to do it.

I will be moving most of my test code here, unless they are really old or unrelevant. _For example:_ Internet Explorer,
Active X, Browser specific code.

Enjoy
