This example create tables with form rows. These rows have adding, editing, saving and removing actions.

Debug the code to understand the usage and behavior. The [Table](./Table.js) class handles all the dynamic table functionality.
The [main.js](./main.js) handles the event registration. This example also uses Delegator design pattern to hande row actions,
