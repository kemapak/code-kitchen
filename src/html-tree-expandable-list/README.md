# HTML Expandable List or Tree web component.

In this sample I expand the HTML `UL` tag to have extra functionality. In other words use the 'decorator' design pattern.
It is very cool to see how a simple UL element turn into an expandable list or a tree.

The element is for sample only does not have the necessary and required accessibility properties. 

For more details how to extend an HTML element please take a look at [MDN - Using Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements).
