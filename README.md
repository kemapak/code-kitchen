# code-kitchen
This is my code kitchen, my lab where I try some concepts, write some sample code, build some prototypes.

Read README.md file for each sample lab. Even the simple HTML/JS/CSS files will have their own. 

Since this is not actual code, I do not have unit tests. I will sometimes combine, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
In real life I will never do this or do not recommend anyone to do it.

I will be moving most of my prototype and test code here, unless they are really really old or irrelevant. _For example:_ Internet Explorer,
Active X, Browser specific code.

Enjoy
