    <h1>JavaScript XSLT Transformation</h1>

    <p>
        This example demonstrates JavaScript XSLT transformation. This API is only available in the browsers.
        This is mostly useless but also very interesting. This idea can be applied to JSON. If we can transform XML
        to HTML why cannot we do the same for JSON?
    </p>
    <p>
        Also keep in mind the fetch does not work since it does not have native XML() method. We have to use AJAX.

        Example data was taken from W3C Schools and books.
